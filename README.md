This repo contains the associated code of the thesis dIAbetes: Analysing diabetes mellitus data using artificial intelligence techniques.
The objective of this thesis is to develop a Machine Learning model that allows predictions about blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes using data from real patients.

All this code has been performed using the T1DiabetesGranada.

The code consists in 6 Google Collab Notebooks:

* Autocorrelation: Exploration of the autocorrelation of the blood glucose (BG) measurements.
* Interporaltion_experiment: Exploration of the interprolation technique for simulating missing data.
* Measurements_distribution: Exploration of the distribution of the BG measurements.
* Outliers: Outliers search.
* Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques. It generates the resampling dataset that is used in the Models notebook.
* Models: The main file of the repository. It creates the three different experiments of the thesis.
